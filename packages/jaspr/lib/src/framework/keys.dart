/// Global keys uniquely identify elements. Global keys provide access to other

///
/// Components that have global keys reparent their subtrees when they are moved
/// from one location in the tree to another location in the tree. In order to
/// reparent its subtree, a component must arrive at its new location in the tree
/// in the same animation frame in which it was removed from its old location in
/// the tree.
///
/// Reparenting an [Element] using a global key is relatively expensive, as
/// this operation will trigger a call to [State.deactivate] on the associated
/// [State] and all of its descendants; then force all components that depends
/// on an [InheritedComponent] to rebuild.
///
/// If you don't need any of the features listed above, consider using a [Key],
/// [ValueKey], or [UniqueKey] instead.
///
/// You cannot simultaneously include two components in the tree with the same
/// global key. Attempting to do so will assert at runtime.
///
/// ## Pitfalls
///
/// GlobalKeys should not be re-created on every build. They should usually be
/// long-lived objects owned by a [State] object, for example.
///
/// Creating a new GlobalKey on every build will throw away the state of the
/// subtree associated with the old key and create a new fresh subtree for the
/// new key. Besides harming performance, this can also cause unexpected
/// behavior in components in the subtree.
///
/// Instead, a good practice is to let a State object own the GlobalKey, and
/// instantiate it outside the build method, such as in [State.initState].
///

///
///  * The discussion at [Component.key] for more information about how components use
///    keys.
